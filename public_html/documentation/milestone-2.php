			<h1>Personal Website Project<br>
				Milestone 2a</h1>
		</header>
		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This project is a professional website starting page.<br><br>
			<strong>Audience:</strong> This site will be targeted towards individuals looking to get more information about me and see some work that i have accomplished. This will include: hiring managers, recruiters, and owners of small businesses.<br><br>
			<strong>Goal:</strong> The goal of this site will be to showcase some of the work I've done. They will have already seen my resume through an online application or e-mail which will have directed them to this portfolio. They will be able to further connect with me through social media profiles and/or a contact form on the page. This page will also serve as a starting point for a much broader online presence which will include a more extensive portfolio of work as well as a technology blog.
