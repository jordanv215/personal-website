			<h1>Personal Website Project<br>
				Milestone 1</h1>
		</header>
		<h2>Purpose, Audience & Goal</h2>
			<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This project is a professional website starting page.<br><br>
			<strong>Audience:</strong> This site will be targeted towards individuals looking to get more information about me and see some work that i have accomplished. This will include: hiring managers, recruiters, and owners of small businesses.<br><br>
			<strong>Goal:</strong> The goal of this site will be to showcase some of the work I've done. They will have already seen my resume through an online application or e-mail which will have directed them to this portfolio. They will be able to further connect with me through social media profiles and/or a contact form on the page. This page will also serve as a starting point for a much broader online presence which will include a more extensive portfolio of work as well as a technology blog.

		<h2>Persona</h2>
			<p><strong>Name: </strong>Charles Harvey<br>
				<strong>Age: </strong>37</p>

			<p><strong>Profession: </strong> Charles is a Software Systems Engineer for Sandia National Laboratories, a national research and development laboratory located in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>

			<p><strong>Technology: </strong>Charles used his work's funding to purchase a 15" Macbook Pro and an iPhone 6 Plus. He also has an older Dell desktop that was recently upgraded to Windows 10 to do testing on Internet Explorer and a Samsung Galaxy S5 to test websites on Android.</p>

			<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors: </strong> Charles knows that his team needs to hire another member because of the amount of work he is doing on a top secret project. He is overwhelmed with the amount of work he is doing and has begun exploring the idea of hiring someone new. As a friend of his, I reached out to him for potential job opportunities several months ago and sent him the link to my website in case this opportunity arose. </p>

			<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> The process to hire may take some time so the sooner that he is able to pick someone, the better. He doesn't necessarily need the most experienced developer, but someone reliable and willing to do the code to get the job done. He's frustrated that the process to get a security clearance is taking 9 months to a year so he understands that he's unable to pass off some of the Q-cleared work, but a new hire would still be a huge weight lifted off his shoulders.</p>

			<p><strong>Goals:</strong>	 Charles' goal would be to have a candidate to submit to the hiring manager as quickly as possible. The sooner that he's able to hire a Web Developer, the sooner he can have some relief in regards to the workload. There are a decent amount of candidates that apply for the position from around the country, but Charles knows that if he's able to hire locally and someone he can trust, he'll be able to get them started sooner.
			</p>

		<h2>Use Case</h2>
			<p>Three months ago, I reached out to Charles Harvey to show my interest in a potential job position in his group at Sandia National Laboratories. I included a link to my portfolio website at that time. Charles' workload has finally become too much to bear and he has received the approval and funding necessary to hire another web developer. He remembers my interest and pulls up my website.<br><br>
			My website portfolio already has an updated resume section with relevant experience and there is also social media links including LinkedIn for a more detailed look at experience. He is able to click on some links and see some websites that I've completed and the type of work that i'm capable of doing. He also opens up the site on his iPhone 6 to make sure the site is mobile friendly and opens it on his Windows desktop to make sure its all standards compliant. <br><br>
			With this quick snapshot, Charles already knows he is able to recommend me for the job position. He forwards my information to the hiring manager and asks to have me scheduled for an interview as soon as possible.
